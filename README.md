# World-Capitals-Quiz

This is one of my first python projects. The program is a quiz, questioning you about countries and expecting a reply with the capital. Countries are never repeated and the quiz comes to an end once you guess all the capitals correctly or give a wrong answer.

Note- Dictionary only contains countries starting with A and B so far as this was meant as a proof of concept
